## Why we exist
Australia's property management industry is failing both property investors and renters. Property managers ignore laws and treat renters with contempt. At the same time, property investors experience poor communication and see their property deteriorate while property managers fail to action repairs. 

There is a better way. When tenants are treated with respect and given the opportunity to make a home, they respond by looking after their home better. Simple things can make a big difference for providing renters with decent homes, while maintaining your investment <em>and</em> reducing tenant turnover.

Look, some property investors don't care about their tenants. If that's you, sign up with somebody else. But if you're a property investor who cares about the wellbeing of your tenants, we are the service for you.
