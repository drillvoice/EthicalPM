# How we're different
Ethical PM is different from old property management companies in three main ways.
<li>
    <ol>Firstly, we have a social purpose to make renting better. This is the reason we exist and it indfluences the decisions we make. At the same time, we want to demonstrate that this approach is also good for property investors. Property management doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.</ol>
    <ol>Secondly, we aim to take the fuss out of repairs. From listening to renters and owners, we know that neglected repairs are a sore point for renters and a frusration for property investors. We are committed to getting repairs done <em>fast</em>, so that your tenants are happier and your property is better looked after.</ol>
    <ol>Thirdly, we want to set a new gold standard in communication. We want to ensure that you always feel confident you know what's happening with your property, and that your tenants never have to reach out to us to follow-up or get an update. We want everyone involved to know what's going on.</ol>
</li>
We aim to be so good that all property investors want to sign up with us -- not just the ethical ones! To experience the difference, <a href="">sign up today</a>.
